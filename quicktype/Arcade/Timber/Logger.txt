Instructions:
Touch the left or right side of the screen to stand on that side and swing your axe.
As you chop out 'chunks' of the tree the branches will move down, don't let them hit you!
Chop as fast as you can - a timer at the top of the screen quickly runs down and you need to chop to replenish it.
The further you go, the faster the time drains... You need to chop faster and faster to keep going.
