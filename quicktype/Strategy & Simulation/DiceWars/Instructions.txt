DICE WARS IS A SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF RISK. THE GOAL IS TO CONTROL AL 42 TERRITORIES. PLAYERS TAKE TURNS TO ATTACK. USE THE ASZX KEYS TO MOVE TO ONE OF YOUR TERRITORIES CONTAINING MORE THAN ONE DIE AND HIT SPACE. THEN USE SPACE TO SELECT AN  ADJACENT TERRITORY HELD BY AN OPPONENT. THE DICE ON THE TWO TERRITORIES ARE ROLLED AND COMPARED. THE ATTACKER WINS IF HE HAS A HIGHER TOTAL.  ALL BUT ONE OF THE DICE ARE MOVED TO THE DEFEATED TERRITORY. OTHERWISE, THE ATTACKER IS REDUCED TO ONE. PLAYERS CAN ATTACK MULTIPLE TIMES.  HIT ENTER TO END TURN.   PLAYERS RECEIVE # OF DICE EQUAL TO THE LARGEST # OF CONTIGUOUS TERRITORIES CONTROLED, WHICH ARE ADDED RANDOMLY THROUGHOUT THE PLAYER'S TERRITORIES. MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DICE ALLOWED ON EACH TERRITORY IS 8. SURPLUS DICE ARE STORED. DICE MAY NOT BE MOVED BETWEEN TERRITORIES, SO FORETHOUGHT AND STRATEGIC PLAY ARE REQUIRED WHEN DECIDING WHERE TO ATTACK.
