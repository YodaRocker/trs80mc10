8000 REM JAZSINC (JEFF SINCLAIR)
8010 JUL 19, 2013
8020 REM THIS MINOTAUR SOUND ROUTINE IS NOT AN INTERRUPT SOUND.
8030 REM I STOPPED MESSING AROUND WITH IT WHEN IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO WORK FOR MINOTAUR. LOL.
8040 REM PROBLEMS WITH THE MC-10 SOUND STATEMENT,
8050 REM 1. IT'S LIMITED. MINOTAUR HAD LOWER NOTES THAN SOUND COULD PLAY.
8060 REM 2. IT'S OUT OF TUNE - THE NOTES AREN'T QUITE WHAT THEY SHOULD BE EVEN RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER.
8070 REM 3. IT'S NOT AN INTERRUPT SOUND EITHER
8080 REM 4. DURATION IS DEPENDENT ON FREQUENCY
8090 REM THE NUMBERS 1 THROUGH 7 STAND IN FOR C THROUGH B
8110 REM 1 C
8120 REM 2 D
8130 REM 3 E
8140 REM 4 F
8150 REM 5 G
8160 REM 6 A
8170 REM 7 B
8180 REM TO PLAY AN OCTAVE HIGHER, PUT A * IN FRONT OF THE NUMBER
8290 REM TO PLAY AN OCTAVE LOWER, PUT A / IN FRONT OF THE NUMBER
8200 REM TO PLAY A SHARP, PUT A + IN FRONT OF THE NUMBER
8210 REM TO PLAY A FLAT, PUT A - IN FRONT OF THE NUMBER
8220 REM FOLLOWING A NUMBER WITH A 0 (ZERO) MAKES IT PLAY LONGER
8230 REM A SPACE PUTS A "REST" NON-PLAYING TIME INTO THE MUSIC
