This is a text adventure I wrote a long while back in GWBASIC. It has
been modified to work with QBASIC, and some of the odder bugs have been
fixed.  It is rather short, and has no save game.  Still, I find it rather
fun, even with its flaws.
Do try to be easy on it though, I was only 10 when I wrote it. (I was an
Infocom nerd, okay?)
The parser is only mildly intelligent. It will accept multiple commands on
the same line, but not multiple objects. (so no TAKE ALL BUT THE BOOK)
You may notice when you start the game that there is no copyright. If you
think you can sell it and make a million dollars, be my guest.  Unfortunately,
the market for GWBASIC games just isn't what it used to be. :)
If you want hints, well, go ahead and ask, I like mail.
